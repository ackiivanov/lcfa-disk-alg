At the level of manifolds, there are functors between the poset $Opns(X)$ and the slice category $Mfld_{/X}$, which we can call $Im: Mfld_{/X} \to Opns(X)$, which takes the image of an embedding, and $Dom: Opns(X) \to Mfld_{/X}$, which takes an open $U$ of $X$ to the canonical embedding $U \subset X$. There is nothing special at the level of morphisms since we're dealing with posets. The two functors together form an equivalence.

Now at the level of disks things change. Denoting by $Disk(X)^{KSW}$ the category of disks as defined in KSW, and by $Disk_{/X}^{AFT}$ the category of disks as defined in AFT, the functor $Im$ descends to $Disk_{/X}^{AFT} \to Disk(X)^{KSW}$, but the functor $Dom$ does \emph{not} descend to a functor of disks since the AFT version of the category is abstractly defined. $Im$ is, however, still an equivalence of categories, but now there is no canonical choice for an inverse. This would normally, not be a big deal.

However, it comes up, for example, in the proof of Theorem 5.10 of KSW, where lemma A.2 requires a choice of functor, for which we then recognize certain conditions.

What is canonically given in that situation is just $\Disk(X)^{KSW} \xleftarrow[\simeq]{Im} Disk_{/X}^{AFT} \rightarrow \mathscr{D}isk_{/X}^{AFT}$, so that before we even start we have to choose some inverse to $Im$, which then, at least, needs additional arguments for why statements that were obvious before are true now.
