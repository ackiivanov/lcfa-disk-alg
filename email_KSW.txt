Interest in your recent paper (2403.19472)

Dear Eilind Karlsson, Claudia Scheimbauer, Tashi Walde,

We've recently read your paper 'Assembly of Constructible Factorization Algebras' and found it quite interesting. We've also been working close to this area and have found similar results to yours.

One that might interest you is a result about the $\infty$-operad of factorization algebras and/or locally constant (i.e. constructible) factorization algebras. Similar to your corollary 5.26, we show that there are equivalences between the $\infty$-categories of locally constant factorization algebras and relative disk algebras, however our approach does not require the assumption of having enough good disks since it is an argument in the style of Ayala-Francis (1903.10961). In fact the equivalence is provided by relative factorization homology. Attached below is a write-up of this result with the accompanying relevant definitions. We would welcome any comments that you might have.

Looking forward to hearing back from you,
Ödül Tetik and Aleksandar Ivanov
